It wouldn't be an alphabet without a table designated for it
![alphabet](https://github.com/hollowness-inside/Colored-Alphabet/blob/main/alphabet.png)
[This alphabet table in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H-gMX3_P3cESRFK0HV_VLRQyaFZVHoAX_yHarkpvNPY/edit?usp=sharing)

Here's how it works:

A letter can be encoded with at most two colors. The first color is called `modifier` and the second, `stem`.

The `modifier` colors are in the left column of the table. 
They are usually darker.
Notice, there's no color for the second row of the table, meaning that the letters in that row are 
encoded with only one color, `stem`.

The `stem` colors are in the first row of the table.

# Colored-Alphabet
An alphabet that is based solely on colors and not shapes of letters

It wouldn't be an alphabet without a table designated for it

[This alphabet table in Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1H-gMX3_P3cESRFK0HV_VLRQyaFZVHoAX_yHarkpvNPY/edit?usp=sharing)

Here's how it works:

A letter can be encoded with at most two colors. The first color is called `modifier` and the second, `stem`.

The `modifier` colors are in the left column of the table. 
They are usually darker.
Notice, there's no color for the second row of the table, meaning that the letters in that row are 
encoded with only one color, `stem`.

The `stem` colors are in the first row of the table.

# [Converter](https://github.com/hollowness-inside/Colored-Alphabet/tree/main/converter)
Use this to convert the Latin alphabet into the Colored alphabet.
The converter is a CLI tool

```
Usage: python3 main.py (-f FILE_NAME) (-t SOME_TEXT) [-l] -o OUTPUT.png
  -l  Draw colors in one row
```

# Imagine
If we were to use a color-based alphabet in our daily lives, it would have several advantages over our current system.

One of the most significant advantages would be the compactness of the text and signs. Color codes would take up much less space than traditional letters, as they only need to be large enough to be distinguishable by the human eye. This would lead to more compact and visually appealing text and signs.

However, the transition to a color-based alphabet could be challenging for web designers and others who work with text and symbols. It would require a significant shift in the way we think about and design text-based content.

On the other hand, for artists and designers, a color-based alphabet could be an exciting opportunity. Colors would bear much more meaning than shapes, which would allow for more expressive and creative uses of color in art and design.

Overall, while there would be some challenges associated with the transition to a color-based alphabet, it could lead to a more visually interesting and compact world, with new opportunities for creative expression.

# Downsides
The colored alphabet system, while innovative and interesting, has several significant downsides that would make it challenging to adopt in everyday life.

Firstly, one of the major downsides is the **difficulty in writing something down**. Unlike the Latin alphabet, which is easy to write using a pencil, pen, or even by scraping letters with your fingernail, the colored alphabet would **require specialized tools or technology** to accurately reproduce the colors of each letter or symbol.

Another significant downside is that the colored alphabet would not be accessible to people with certain disabilities, such as **colorblindness**. Colorblind individuals would **miss out on chunks of text** because of their inability to distinguish between certain colors, making the system inaccessible for them. Additionally, for **people with epilepsy**, the flashing and changing of colors could **trigger seizures**, which could be dangerous.

Overall, while the colored alphabet is an intriguing concept, its downsides make it challenging to adopt in everyday life. With whole my heart I hope it may have potential in certain specialized fields or communities.
